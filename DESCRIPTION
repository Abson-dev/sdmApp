Description: A 'shiny' 
    application that allows non-expert 'R' users to easily model
    species distribution. It offers a reproducible work flow for
    species distribution modeling into a single and user friendly environment.
    'sdmApp' takes 'raster' data (in format supported by the 'raster package') 
    and species occurrence data (several format supported) as input argument.
    It provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
