Description: This package is containing a shiny application
    that allows non-expert R users to easily model species distribution.
    It offers a reproducible workflow for species distribution modeling
    into a single and user friendly environment. sdmApp takes 'raster'
    data (in format supported by the raster package) and species
    occurrence data (several format supported) as input argument. The
    'sdmApp' provides an interactive, graphical user interface (GUI).
