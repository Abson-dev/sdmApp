Description: 'sdmApp' is a 'R' 'package' containing a 'Shiny' application that allows non-expert 'R' users to easily model species distribution. It offers a reproducible work flow for species distribution modeling into a single and user friendly environment. 'sdmApp' takes 'Raster' data (in format supported by the 'Raster package') and species occurrence data (several format supported) as input argument. This 'package' provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
